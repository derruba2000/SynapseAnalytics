If you weren't the only company I've been able to find that even has these items, I would have stopped ordering from you a long time ago. I order weekly and it seems like at least once a month my order has some kind of foul-up. Waiting for the order to be corrected would set my business back so I need to keep extra on hand just in case. Not fair for me to have to carry extra inventory to make up for YOUR screw-ups! Hire someone who can tell the difference between a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit. If anyone reading this knows of another source please let me know.\":1,\"David, sorry, it's whatchamacallits I'm looking for. I should have been more specific. Can't find them anywhere. Of course the dolts at Fabrikam are no help.\":1,\"Hi folks. According to your encabulator brochure, the hydrocoptic marzlevanes are supposed to prevent side fumbling. In fact, I bought your retro-encabulator because of your claims that it was highly resistant to this problem. However, I'm seeing a lot of side fumbling anyway. Am I doing something wrong or do I have a defective unit?\":1,\"I ordered three widgets last week and just received them. I am VERY disappointed in the way they were packed. The box was only about two thirds full of packing peanuts and the widgets were not individually wrapped. As a result they were able to bump up against each other while in transit. The display on one doesn't work at all and the other two are quite scratched up (look like they have been in service for years) though they do work fine. I have always been satisifed with your service and trust you will make this right, but I suggest you look into how you are packing these items. You will have a lot of unhappy customers otherwise.\":1,\"I put my wedding ring in a Bag of Holding I purchased from you guys (for safekeeping while at work) and it turned into lead! What the heck? I'm really going to be in the doghouse.\":1,\"Jake, I've had similar problems tracking down another source of thingamabobs. (Or is it whatchamacallits you need?) I have found Contoso Supply to have thingamabobs but not reliably. Maybe if they started getting more orders for them this would improve.\":1,\"Jake, it's probably none of my business, but you will probably get a better response if you don't insult the people you want help from.\":1,\"Maria, I'm pretty sure the folks at Fabrikam use photos of actual customers in their brochures. Those hands are obviously the hands of someone who uses the product! I think it's great!\":1,\"That hand model needs a manicure, stat!\":1,\"Wow! I had NO IDEA that reciprocating garombles of such high quality even existed! And they're a steal, too; I've paid twice your asking price for garombles that weren't nearly as smooth in operation. Free ground delivery was a plus (the overnight shipping seems a little spendy though). We'll see how these actually hold up, but so far I'm sold!\":1}}",
